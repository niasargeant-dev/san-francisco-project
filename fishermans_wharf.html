        <p>
            Fisherman's Wharf gets its name and neighborhood characteristics from
            the city's early days during the Gold Rush where Italian emigre fishermen
            settled in the area and fished for the Dungeness Crab. From then until
            present day it remained the home base of San Francisco's fishing fleet.
            Despite its redevelopment into a tourist attraction during the 1970s and
            1980s, the area is still home to many active fishermen and their fleets.
