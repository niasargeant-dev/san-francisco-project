            San Francisco's Chinatown is the oldest Chinatown in North America and one of the largest Chinese
            neighborhoods outside Asia. Since its establishment in the 1840s, it has been highly important and
            influential in the history and culture of ethnic Chinese immigrants to the United States and North America.
            Chinatown is an active enclave that continues to retain its own customs, languages, places of worship,
            social clubs, and identity.

            Popularly known as a "city-within-a-city", it has developed its own government, traditions, over 300
            restaurants, and as many shops. There are two hospitals, numerous parks and squares, a post office, and
            other infrastructure. Visitors can easily become immersed in a microcosmic Asian world, filled with herbal
            shops, temples, pagoda roofs and dragon parades. In addition to it being a starting point and home for
            thousands of Chinese immigrants, it is also a major tourist attraction, drawing more visitors annually to
            the neighborhood than the Golden Gate Bridge.
