# San Francisco Project

This project was created as part of a group assignment to practice HTML and CSS skills. The objective was to build a five-page website about San Francisco, including key attractions. Content on this site has been obtained from various online sources and is intended for **educational purposes only**.


## Project Overview
- Designed using HTML and CSS (no frameworks or templates).
- Group collaboration with defined roles (e.g., layout design, content structuring).
- Each page is structured with consistent design principles.
- No JavaScript or additional programming languages used.

## Challenges

1. **Consistency**: 
   - **Challenge**: The project required maintaining a consistent design across all five pages, including typography, color schemes, and layout structure.
   - **Solution**: A global CSS file was created to define common styles for the entire website, ensuring consistency. Additionally, reusable components like the navigation bar and footer were implemented across all pages to maintain uniformity.

2. **Coordinating Group Work Efficiently**:
   - **Challenge**: With multiple team members working on different pages of the website, ensuring smooth collaboration and integration of each section was a challenge.
   - **Solution**: The team established clear roles and communication channels, using tools like Google Drive for shared resources. Regular team meetings were held to review progress and make sure all pages followed the same structure.
