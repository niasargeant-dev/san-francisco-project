            The San Francisco cable car system is the world's last permanently operational manually operated cable car
            system, in the US sense of a tramway whose cars are pulled along by cables embedded in the street. It is an
            icon
            of San Francisco, California. The cable car system forms part of the intermodal urban transport network
            operated
            by the San Francisco Municipal Railway, or "Muni" as it is better known. Cable cars operate on two routes
            from
            downtown near Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf, and a third route along California Street. While the cable
            cars
            are used to a certain extent by commuters, their small service area and premium fares for single rides make
            them
            more of a tourist attraction. They are among the most significant tourist sites in the city, along with
            Alcatraz
            Island and Fisherman's Wharf.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is the only transportation system listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
            The cable cars are not to be confused with San Francisco's historic streetcars, which operate on Market
            Street and on the Embarcadero.
